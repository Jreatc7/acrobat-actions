# Actions (old Batch Processing)

Only available in Acrobat Professional. Used to be called Batch processing, changed to Actions in Acrobat X. Actions are a way to apply a series of commands to one or more files and is the type of automation accessible to the largest number of users since it does not require scripting. Acrobat's Action wizard provides a set of predefined commands that the user can choose from to build a custom sequence. These commands are almost exactly the same operations that can be applied manually from the regular Acrobat Tools. But one of the commands is "Run a JavaScript" which adds extra flexibility to what can be done with an Action. The JavaScript commands that can be used in an Action are nearly the same as what can be used in a trusted function.
