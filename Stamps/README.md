Cisco icons are globally recognized and generally accepted as standard for network icon topologies. You may use them freely, but you may not alter them.

## What Is Network Topology?

Network topology is used to describe the physical and logical structure of a network. It maps the way different nodes on a network--including switches and routers--are placed and interconnected, as well as how data flows. Diagramming the locations of endpoints and service requirements helps determine the best placement for each node to optimize traffic flows.
